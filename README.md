# SprotsAgent: The Python-based Sports Agent Script

Welcome to SprotsAgent, the Python-based sports agent script that's so good, it might just replace real sports agents (just kidding, we love you, sports agents). This script acts as a virtual sports agent, automating tasks related to player management, contract negotiation, performance tracking, and communication via email and text messaging. It's also a social butterfly, networking on LinkedIn and issuing media comments. The goal? To streamline and automate various tasks typically performed by a sports agent, and to do it with a bit of Pythonic flair.

## Technologies

- Python: Because who doesn't love a snake named after a comedy group?
- Flask or Django: Because we like our web frameworks like we like our coffee - full-bodied and with a kick.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The holy trinity of frontend development.
- SQLite or PostgreSQL: Because data needs a home too.
- Email integration using SMTP libraries (e.g., smtplib): Because carrier pigeons are so last millennium.
- Text messaging integration using SMS gateway providers (e.g., Twilio): Because who has time for phone calls?
- LinkedIn integration using the LinkedIn API and Python libraries (e.g., python-linkedin): Because networking is not just for computers.

## Features

### Player Information Management

- Store and manage player profiles, including personal details, team affiliations, and performance history. It's like a Rolodex, but better.
- Add, update, and delete player information. Because change is the only constant.
- Retrieve player information based on various criteria (e.g., name, sport, team). It's like Google, but for your players.

### Contract Negotiation Support

- Generate contract templates for different sports and contract types. Because one size doesn't fit all.
- Customize contract terms (e.g., salary, contract duration) based on player and team requirements. Because negotiation is an art.
- Calculate contract-related metrics, such as salary cap impact and contract value. Because math is hard.

### Performance Tracking

- Track and store player performance data, including statistics, game logs, and achievements. Because numbers don't lie.
- Analyze and visualize performance data to assess player progress and identify trends. Because a picture is worth a thousand words.

### Communication

- Integration with email services to send and receive emails related to player contracts, negotiations, and general communication. Because communication is key.
- Integration with SMS services to send text messages to players, teams, or other stakeholders. Because sometimes, you just need to send a text.

### Social Media Networking (LinkedIn)

- Integration with the LinkedIn API to facilitate networking and communication with relevant industry professionals. Because it's not what you know, it's who you know.
- Retrieve and update player profiles on LinkedIn. Because keeping up appearances is important.
- Send messages and establish connections with other LinkedIn users. Because sliding into DMs isn't just for Instagram.
