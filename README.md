# SprotsAgent

Welcome to SprotsAgent, the Python-based sports agent script that's so good, it might just replace real sports agents (just kidding, we love you guys!). This script is like a virtual sports agent on steroids (not literally, we're all about fair play here). It automates tasks related to player management, contract negotiation, performance tracking, communication via email and text messaging, social media networking (specifically LinkedIn), and issuing media comments. It's like having a sports agent, secretary, and social media manager all rolled into one, without the hefty salary demands!

## Technologies

We're using all the cool kids on the block:

- Python for backend development (because who doesn't love snakes)
- Flask or Django for the web framework (depending on whether you prefer flasks or guitars)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface (the holy trinity of web development)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for the database (because data is the new oil)
- Email integration using SMTP libraries (like a digital postman)
- Text messaging integration using SMS gateway providers (because who calls anymore)
- LinkedIn integration using the LinkedIn API and Python libraries (for all the professional stalking)

## Features

### Player Information Management

- Store and manage player profiles, including personal details, team affiliations, and performance history (like a digital Rolodex for players)
- Add, update, and delete player information (because change is the only constant)
- Retrieve player information based on various criteria (like a search engine for players)

### Contract Negotiation Support

- Generate contract templates for different sports and contract types (because who has time to write contracts from scratch)
- Customize contract terms (e.g., salary, contract duration) based on player and team requirements (because one size doesn't fit all)
- Calculate contract-related metrics, such as salary cap impact and contract value (so you don't have to do the math)

### Performance Tracking

- Track and store player performance data, including statistics, game logs, and achievements (like a digital trophy cabinet)
- Analyze and visualize performance data to assess player progress and identify trends (because a picture is worth a thousand words)

### Communication

- Integration with email services to send and receive emails related to player contracts, negotiations, and general communication (like a digital pigeon)
- Integration with SMS services to send text messages to players, teams, or other stakeholders (because sometimes, 160 characters is all you need)

### Social Media Networking (LinkedIn)

- Integration with the LinkedIn API to facilitate networking and communication with relevant industry professionals (because it's not what you know, it's who you know)
- Retrieve and update player profiles on LinkedIn (to keep your digital resume up-to-date)
- Send messages and establish connections with other LinkedIn users (because networking is the key to success)

## Contributing

We're on the lookout for contributors who can help us make this project even better.
